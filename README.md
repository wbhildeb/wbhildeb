### Hey! Welcome to my GitHub 👋

I'm a fourth-year student at Univerisy of Waterloo pursuing my Bachelors of Computer Science. I'm trying to figure out what I want to do in the space of Computer Science and am currently looking at machine learning, infrastructure/tools development, as well as big data. Outside of school and work, I'm a musicophile whose been learning to play guitar and a bit of bass and piano in my spare time.

I wouldn't use the word ✨*polished*✨ for my repositories here. I tend to use these projects as a way to learn new technologies, and then move on to my next new passion or lose focus when work or school picks up. That being said I think I have some pretty cool projects so feel free to check them out!
