### Hey! Welcome to my GitHub üëã

### Let's be quick about this:

üéì Bachelor's of Computer Science with Distinction at University of Waterloo

üíº Incoming SWE at Meta in November 2022 - right now I'm just *vibing* ‚òØÔ∏è

üîé My interests currently tend towards **big data** and **infra/tools development**. Recently, I've also been interested in prevention of fraud/misinformation of social media

I wouldn't use the word ‚ú®*polished*‚ú® for my repositories here. I tend to use these projects as a way to learn new technologies, and then move on to my next new passion or lose focus when work or school picks up. That being said I think I have some pretty cool projects so feel free to check them out!


### My Latest Internships üë®üèº‚Äçüíª
üçÅ **Fall 2021 at Facebook/Meta:**
I intered at Facebook during the Haugen whistleblower controversy, the company-wide blackout and the Facebook -> Meta change. It was interesting to say the least. I worked on a data pipeline to monitor and analyze the health of Facebook's enormous delivery network.

‚ùÑÔ∏è **Winter 2021 at NVIDIA:**
I worked as a Performance Software Engineering Intern on the [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) team where I contributed to the realease of TenosrRT 8.0, and implemented e2e validation for compilation and inference of Tacotron2 and BERT HF engines

‚òÄÔ∏è **Summer 2020 at NVIDIA:**
My role was a CAD Software Architect on the Hardware Infrastructure team. I was responsible for improving internal tools that VLSI engineers used to develop dies and graphics cards.

üçÅ **Fall 2019 at McAfee:**
As a software developer on McAfee WebAdvisor, I focused mostly on internal tools and had a lot of freedom to come up with my own ideas for  tools. One tool I came up with and developed was a program that allowed developers and testers to use a CLI to edit Chrome's internal extension storage.
