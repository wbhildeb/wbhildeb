Hi, I'm a University of Waterloo grad living in San Francisco and taking some time to myslef.

I interned at McAfee, NVIDIA and Meta and moved to SF to work at Meta just three days before the massive layoffs in November 2022.

From there, I worked as a Infra Software Engineer at Voxel AI which used computer vision to provide safety and operational insights in industrial spaces.
